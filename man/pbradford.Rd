\usage{
pbradford(x, c = 5, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of quantiles. Must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{c}{parameter of the standardized bradford distribution. Must be
greater than 0.}

\item{lower.tail}{logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are given as
P(x<=X); otherwise, P(x > X).}

\item{log.p}{logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p)}
}
\value{
a vector of \code{length(x)} with accumulated distribution probabilities.
}
\description{
This function returns probabilities from the accumulated distribution function
of the Bradford Distribution.
}
